# 🕹️ Survive Game
An Android mini-game where your national ID number determines your survival path.

# 🎮 Gameplay Summary
Enter your 9-digit Israeli ID number and test your ability to survive by following a secret directional sequence derived from it.

# 🔢 How It Works:
The user inputs a valid 9-digit ID.

Each digit is converted into a direction using: digit % 4

The player must tap the arrow buttons in the correct sequence:

0 → Left

1 → Right

2 → Up

3 → Down

Once all moves are entered:

## ✅ If all directions were correct → Toast: "Survived in [City]"

## ❌ If any step was incorrect → Toast: "You Failed"
